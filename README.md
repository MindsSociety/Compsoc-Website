Feel free to fork this website and use it for whatever. 

**Note**: There are a few files we have omitted for security.
- `config/secrets.yml` - Contains development keys.

These files can be found in our private Repo, committee members and website

these, in the mean time, you may need to spoof these to get the website up and
running
